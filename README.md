# update_gits
A simple bash script to update all git repositories in your local disk. Useful if you don't track and remember those repositories that you cloned some time ago and you want to keep everything up to date. 

**`WARNING!`**
- It does not take into account previously done local changes.
- This might not be the best idea to update the repos, since it may perform changes that could 'break' something and make it unusable.

## How to use it
```
# chmod +x
# ./update_gits.sh
```
